We watched fireworks from **16A Hàng Trống**—not like a grand plan, more like an accidental ritual.

The city turned into a giant speaker. Light hit the smoke, then disappeared. Everyone was filming, laughing, yelling, losing count. Up there, the air felt different—like we were standing in a page someone cut out of a magazine and kept in their pocket for later.

Some moments were sharp. Some were blurry. All of them felt real.

If the year had a first scene, this was it.
