About a month before we even met (if my memory isnt trolling me), she walked out of a friends wedding and got this random cosmic ping like: “go dye ur hair purple, nowwwwww”.

So she did. 💜🖤

The thing is, purple/violet has been my favorite color forever, all my (close) friend knows it, but i never said it out loud. i did dropped some hints tho. but like… did she stalk me or nah ?

Anw, thats when i knew, ngl, the universe was lowkey syncing us one way or another.

its kinda creepy… but also kinda perfect.
